## Description

The SQL scripts in this repository are designed to manage a university's student and course data. The main components are:

- **`GroupS11221203_A2_CreateStructures.sql`**: This script contains the `CREATE TABLE` statements to build the database schema.
- **`GroupS11221203_A2_InsertData.sql`**: This script contains the `INSERT` statements to populate the database with initial data.
- **`GroupS11221203_A2_Queries.sql`**: This script contains a series of queries to retrieve information from the database. These queries cover a range of topics, including:
    - Listing candidates and their qualifications.
    - Identifying companies that have hired students.
    - Finding candidates who require further education.
    - Checking for outstanding student fees.
    - Reporting on job openings and candidate suitability.

## How to Run

To use these scripts, you will need to have MySQL installed and running. You can execute the scripts from the MySQL command line interface.

1.  **Create the database structure:**
    ```bash
    mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < GroupS11221203_A2_CreateStructures.sql
    ```

2.  **Insert the data:**
    ```bash
    mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < GroupS11221203_A2_InsertData.sql
    ```

3.  **Run the queries:**
    ```bash
    mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < GroupS11221203_A2_Queries.sql
    ```

    You will be prompted to enter your MySQL password after running each command. Replace `your_username` and `your_database_name` with your MySQL username and the name of the database you want to use.
